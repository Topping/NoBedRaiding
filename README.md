# NoBedRaiding
Silly Rust game plugin to control offline raiding.

Requires Oxide on the server.

Should use the clan plugin with this. https://umod.org/plugins/clans

All times mention in config json are in the UTC timezone.

I'm not maintaining this at all, but you can open an issue, ping me or similar and we can figure something out.
